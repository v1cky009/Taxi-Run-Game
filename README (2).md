The purpose of the Car run game project is to develop an
interactive and entertaining game that simulates the
experience of driving a car in a bustling city. The main
objective is to create an immersive gameplay experience that
challenges the player's driving skills, time management, and
decision-making abilities.
The game mechanics involve controlling a car through city

environment, encountering various obstacles such as traffic,
pedestrians, and other vehicles.
